# kbLit - External Keyboard Backlight Binding
Some external keyboards desiged for the low-end and loiw-budget gaming community tend to have a static lighting in the background and make use of the scroll lock key to turn the lights ON and Off. While it isn't a huge issue in modern systems, applications like MS Excel tend to lose some functionality when backlight in on. However, while this support exists for Mac and Windows, Linux does not work with such keyboard designs. Hence this little script

### Usage 
Enter 'kblit' in your console or Terminal to toggle the status of the backlight

### Installation
cd kblit  
make  
sudo make install
